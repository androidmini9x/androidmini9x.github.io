## First Section
Maritime traffic came to a standstill this morning when a 50-foot inflatable rubber duck 
drifted into the central shipping channel. Tugboats were dispatched to push the cheerful 
yellow obstruction to the side, but every attempt failed as the duck's glossy surface 
proved too slippery for ropes to hold. 

### First Section
The origin of the oversized bath toy remains a mystery, though residents suspect it 
might be part of an elaborate art installation or an extremely dedicated prank. 
Ferry passengers cheered and took photos, while one captain was overheard muttering, 
"This is the dumbest reason I've ever been late."
