A man in a silver jumpsuit appeared suddenly in the middle of 5th Avenue yesterday afternoon, 
causing traffic to halt and pedestrians to swarm him with camera phones. Witnesses say he 
spoke in rapid, unfamiliar slang and pulled strange metallic devices from his pockets, 
producing flashes of light and brief bursts of static-filled music. 

Authorities initially assumed he was a street performer with a sci-fi theme, 
but when asked for identification, he presented a "chronometric visa" 
dated for the year 2483. The man was last seen boarding a city bus, muttering 
about "finding the nexus point before the parade."
