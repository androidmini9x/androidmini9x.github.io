title: Local Library Discovers Secret Basement

During renovations at the Willowbrook Public Library, construction crews broke through 
what appeared to be a solid brick wall—only to find a hidden staircase leading down 
to a dusty, dimly lit basement. Inside were rows of shelves containing books bound 
in unfamiliar materials, handwritten journals with no listed authors, and a brass 
machine with dozens of gears still faintly ticking.

The library’s director has cordoned off the area for "archival study," though rumors 
among staff suggest the books detail events that haven’t happened yet. One volunteer 
claimed they saw a map of the town with several buildings circled—buildings that 
don’t currently exist.
